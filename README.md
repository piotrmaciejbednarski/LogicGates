This Spigot plugin provides a compact and efficient way to build logic gates directly within your Minecraft world.

## Features

- **Extensive Gate Selection**: Build one of the 7 basic logic gates (NOT, OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, XNOR) and additional gates such as implication, TIMER (oscillator), or RS-Latch (memory gate).
- **Intuitive Interface**: Choose gates using a graphical interface (GUI).
- **High Performance**: The plugin runs efficiently thanks to a system of synchronization with server ticks, task queuing, batch processing, and many optimization techniques.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: The plugin's compact size (under 60kB) contributes to its efficient performance and low resource usage.
- **Ready to Use**: After installation, the plugin is immediately ready to use, no configuration is required.
- **Easy Internationalization**: Add your own plugin translations by editing the messages.yml file.
- **JSON Saving**: Gates are saved in JSON format, which makes them easy to process by external software.
- **Unlimited Possibilities**: Develop and create even more advanced Redstone mechanisms.
- **WorldEdit Integration**: The plugin integrates with the WorldEdit API, allowing you to copy and paste gates.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `LogicGates.jar` from [Releases](https://github.com/piotrmaciejbednarski/logicgates/releases)
2. Place the JAR file in your server's `plugins/` directory
3. Restart your Minecraft server

## How it works?

The core element of every logic gate is the `minecraft:glass` (Glass) block, which serves as the main component. This is where the input and output signals are connected.

Each gate performs a specific logical operation based on the redstone signals provided at its inputs. The inputs are marked with **particle colors** to help with identification and proper connection:

- **Red** â€“ first input
- **Blue** â€“ second input
- **Light Blue** â€“ third input (for gates with three input signals)

The gate's output is marked with a **green color** and transmits the result of the logical operation to other components in the circuit using redstone signals.
